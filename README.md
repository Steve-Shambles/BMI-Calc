# BMI-Calc
A Body Mass Index calculator, with Tkinter GUI. What annoys me about other similar programs is they only offer you option of pounds and centimeters
whereas I personally still use stones and inches, others use kilograms, so I added those.

Take note that the BMI system itself is far from perfect and can get it very wrong for some body types,

so please see important notes in the drop-down info menu before you panic ;-)

Works on Windows 7, should work on Linux, not tested yet.
