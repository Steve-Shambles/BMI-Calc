# BMI-Calc
A very simple Body Mass Index calculator with CustomTkinter GUI. 

I tried to improve on the dour stock look of Tkinter by using the addon CustomTkinter.
Being a twat-noob I am sure I haven't done CTk any justice, but I tried my best.

Note: Pyinstaller wouldn't\couldn't create an .exe file for this, so it looks like I will have to stick to plain old Tkinter until I find the solution.

Works on Windows 7, should work on Linux, not tested yet.
