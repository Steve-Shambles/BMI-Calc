# BMI-Calc
A Body Mass Index calculator, with Tkinter GUI. What annoys me about other similar programs is they only offer you option of pounds and meters whereas I personally still use stones and inches, others use kilograms, so I added those in here for everyone's delectation, innit.

Works on Windows 7, should work on Linux, not tested yet.
